 ## Repositories:
 
 1. [Amorphous Materials Modeling](https://github.com/i-bishalb/Amorphous_Modeling) 
    1. [Random Amorphous Configuration](https://github.com/i-bishalb/Amorphous_Modeling/blob/main/Random_amorphous_configuration/Random_Configuration_Generator.py): This python code produces random amorphous configuration needed to start molecular dynamics (MD) calculation. The final file is in VASP input POSCAR format. All the atoms in the final configuration are separated by at least 1.8 Angstrom and the atoms satisfy periodic boundary conditions.
    2. [Vibrational density of states](https://github.com/i-bishalb/Amorphous_Modeling/blob/main/Vibrational_density_of_states/VASP_OUTCAR_to_TOTAL_VDOS.py): This python code uses **CONTCAR** and **OUTCAR** file obtained after phonon calculations (IBRION=5) in VASP. To calculate total vibrational density of states(VDOS) and plot the total vibrational states. The **CONTCAR** and **OUTCAR** file must be present in the same folder as the code.
     
 
 2. [Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningProjects)
    This repository contains some of the projects that I carried out for my learning and interest.
    1. **Text Classification (Natural Language Processing)**
       1. [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningProjects/blob/main/Sentiment_Analysis/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb): 
          In this project, I have utilized **NLTK** tools such as **Tokenizer**, **PorterStemmer**, **stopwords**, **sklearn** tools such as **CountVectorizer**, **TF-IDF** and tools from **BeautifulSoup** to parse raw-text/html data to convert into machine learning processed vectors. The dataset is IMBD user review and the target variable being the sentiment(postive or negative). I have utilized logistic-regression to train my models after pre-processing. The models produces 91% accuracy with good numbers for both Precision and Recall.
   

 3. [Machine Learning Assignments (Small projects)](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments)
    These are some of the projects that were carried out while taking courses with machine learning.
    1. **Regression**
       1. [Predicting Housing Prices](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments/blob/main/Predicting_Housing_Prices_Regression/Predicting_Housing_Prices_Regression.ipynb): 
     In this project, I have predicted housing prices using the boston housing data. I have used **Linear Regression** and regularized regression methods: **Lasso Regression**, **Ridge Regression** and **ElasticNet Regression** to predict the housing prices. Polynomial of degree 2 does a good job in predicting housing prices. Best models for each method were selected using extensive gridsearch. All 3 regularized models (**Lasso Regression**, **Ridge Regression** and **ElasticNet Regression**) show similar accuracy for prediction. 
       2. [California Housing Prices](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments/blob/main/Housing_Prices_Regression/California_Housing_Regression.ipynb): 
      In this project, I have carried out regression calculations to predict housing prices using the california housing data. I have used Linear models:
      **Linear Regression**, **Ridge Regression** and Non-linear models **Random Forest Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbor Regression** and **Support Vector Machine Regression (with gaussian kernel (rbf))**. The model highlights the complexity in some dataset and the need to use non-linear or beyond linear models to get an accurate prediction.
     2. **Classification**
        1. [Churn Prediction](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments/blob/main/Bank_Customers_Churn_Classification/Churn_Classification.ipynb): 
           In this project, I have carried out binary classification prediction to predict customers churning or not-churing. I have used 7 classifiers for the problem namely: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, **Decision Tree Classifier**, **K Neighbors Classifier**, **Support Vector Machine Classifier** and Boosting methods **Ada Boost Classifier** and **Gradient Boosting Classifier**. The two boosting methods and Random Forest Classifier have the best predictions. A majority **Voting classifier** shows same accuracy as the best three classifiers. 
        2. [Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments/blob/main/Loan_Default_Prediction/Single_family_loan_prediction.ipynb): 
           In this project, I have carried out classification prediction to predict whether a loan will default or not. I have used 4 classifires for the problem: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, **K Neighbors Classifier** and **Gradient Boosting Classifier**. The simplest classifier (Logistic Regression) does the best job of predicting loan default.
 
    3. **Deep Learning and Neural Networks**
        1.[Fashion Classification](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments/blob/main/Zalando_Fashion_Classification/Zalando_Clothing_Classification.ipynb):
         In this project, I have
