    1. [Predicting Housing Prices (Regression)](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningProjects/blob/main/Predicting_Housing_Prices_Regression/Predicting_Housing_Prices_Regression.ipynb): <br>
       In this project, I have predicted housing prices using the boston housing data. I have used **Linear Regression** and regularized regression methods: **Lasso regression**, **Ridge regression** and **ElasticNet** to predict the housing prices. Polynomial of degree 2 does a good job in predicting housing prices. Best models for each method were selected using extensive gridsearch. All 3 regularized models (**Lasso regression**, **Ridge regression** and **ElasticNet**) show similar accuracy for prediction.
